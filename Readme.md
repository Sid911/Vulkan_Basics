# Vulkan Basics
This repo follows https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ as a source reference with some modifications of my own to create a 3d renderer. My goal was to learn the basics of vulkan and how it works.
This is in a single file for the most part.

Supports
- Depth Buffer
- Textures (Single per object) using `stb_iamge`
- Model loading using `tiny_obj_loader` library for obj objects
- Automatic runtime mipmap generation
- Multisampling
